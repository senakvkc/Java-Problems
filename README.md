This repository contains problems to help understand the basic concepts of programming. 

## PowerFunction.java

Given two doubles, base and exponent, power function calculates base over exponent. 

* Iterative approach
* Checks special cases like when exponent is equal to 1 or 0.
* Works with negative numbers too.

## RecursivePower.java

Given two doubles, base and exponent, our function calculates the base over exponent using recursive approach.

* Recursive approach
* Checks special cases like when exponent is equal to 1 or 0.
* Works with negative numbers too.
