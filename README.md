# Java-Problems

This repository contains problems to help understand the basic concepts of programming. 

## PowerFunction.java

Given two doubles, base and exponent, power function calculates base over exponent. 

* Iterative approach
* Checks special cases like when exponent is equal to 1 or 0.
* Works with negative numbers too.

## RecursivePower.java

Given two doubles, base and exponent, our function calculates the base over exponent using recursive approach.

* Recursive approach
* Checks special cases like when exponent is equal to 1 or 0.
* Works with negative numbers too.

## RecursiveFactorial.java

Given an integer called n, our function calculates the factorial of it. Example: n! = n.(n-1).(n-2)...1

* Recursive approach
* Checks if n is equal to 1 or 0 or not
